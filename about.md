# Welcome!

This is a blog on mathematics & software. The ongoing theme of the posts should mostly revolve around turning mathematical insights into practical software solutions. The name *Simple Complexity* is motivated by the idea that the main added value of theory is an increase in clarity and understanding of complicated concepts.[^1]
