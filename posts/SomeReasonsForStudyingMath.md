# Some Reasons for Studying Math

By **Samuel Belko**, published on September 29, 2023.

In my opinion, studying math should ideally make you a person that is able to *increase clarity* of a wide range of ideas.

Some other reasons include:
- **_usefulness_**
  - source of applicable methods
  - foundation for science & technological innovation
  - improvement of general problem solving & communication skills
  - becoming a person with a high standard for conceptual clarity
  - developing an intuition for encoding patterns into suggestive notation & diagrams that make it easier to understand a concept
- **_aesthetic appeal_**
  - reduction to the essence
  - attention to detail
  - consistency, coherence
  - unexpected connections
  - compositionality, extension of simpler objects by compatible structures
  - compact form via abstraction hierarchies
  - existence of many well-written theory expositions
- **_mind-stretching concepts_**
  - source of many *Aha!* moments
- **_ingenuity & originality_**
  - creative thinking is encouraged and celebrated
- **_flexibility & universality_** 
  - efficient adaptation to a rapidly changing world by extending and reusing knowledge
  - experiencing a compounding effect
