  - source of applicable methods
  - foundation for science and R&D
- **_aesthetic appeal_**
  - reduction to the essence
  - attention to detail
  - consistency, coherence
  - unexpected connections
  - compact form via abstraction hierarchies
  - existence of many well-written theory expositions
- **_mind-stretching concepts_**
  - source of many *Aha!* moments
- **_ingenuity & originality_**
  - creative thinking is encouraged and celebrated
- **_flexibility & universality_** 
  - efficient adaptation to a rapidly changing world by extending and reusing knowledge
  - experiencing a compounding effect
