# A List of Outstanding Theory Books

By **Samuel Belko**, published on November 7, 2023.

There are many math books out there, but some of them are truly impressive works. In this post, I would like to share a list of those that I personally admire for their consistency, attention to detail, surprising remarks and overall clarity of thought. 

I noticed that usually textbooks in 3th, 4th or later editions are pretty good candidates for being outstanding theory expositions.

My list is of course biased by my own interests. I don't claim to have read every book cover to cover, but with each one I spend enough many hours to know it definitely should be mentioned here.

There are some good candidates that I omit for now, but I might add them later once I have a more complete impression of them.

**A list of outstanding theory books:**

- *Convex Optimization* Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe. 2004.
- *Probability theory--a comprehensive course.* Achim Klenke. Third Edition. 2020.
- *Combinatorial optimization. Polyhedra and efficiency.* Alexander Schrijver. 2003
- *Integer programming.*  Michele Conforti, Gérard Cornuéjols, Giacomo Zambelli. 2014.

Some interesting & non-standard problems can be found in:

- *Mathematical tapas. Vol. 1 (for undergraduates).* Jean-Baptiste Hiriart-Urruty. 2016.
- *Mathematical tapas. Vol. 2 (from undergraduate to graduate level)* Jean-Baptiste Hiriart-Urruty. 2017.
